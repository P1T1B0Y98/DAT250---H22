# Experiment 4

No major technical issues or problems encountered. It took some time to get to know how the Spark Framework worked, however, after some effort there
is really no pending issues I did not manage to solve for Experiment 1 and 2. I decided not do to assignment 3 and 4 because they were listed 
as optional. However I might do it in the future.
