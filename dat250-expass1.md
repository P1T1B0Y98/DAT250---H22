# Lab Assignment 1

This is a short lab report for the first lab assignment in DAT 250. In this assignment we where to deploy a small Java application in the cloud using the Heroku cloud application platform. In this report I am going to address the following: 

  - Technical problems that you encountered during installation of the software development environment and how you have solved them
  - How you have validated (checked) that the software development environment is working
  - Technical problems encountered with the Heroku platform and how you solved them
  - Any pending issues with this assignment which you did not manage to solve

## Technical problems encountered
Did not really have any technical problems apart from that I found out that I had to install Homebrew to download Maven for MacOS. 

## Validation
To validate that the software development environment is working i ran "application name" -version in temrinal to validate that they are downloaded and working on my machine. Additionally I tried to login to Heroku in the terminal so that I could continue with the tutorial. 

## Technical Problems With Heroku 
None encountered. 

## Pending Issues
No pending issues with the assignment
