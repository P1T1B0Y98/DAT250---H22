# Lab Assignment 2

This is a lab report for lab assignment 2 in DAT250. In the report I am going to discuss and address the following:

 - Technical problems that you encountered during installation and use of Java Persistence Architecture (JPA) and how you resolved

 - A link to your code for experiment 2 above. Make sure the included test case passes!

 - An explanation of how you inspected the database tables and what tables were created. For the latter, you may provide screenshots.

 - Any pending issues with this assignment that you did not manage to solve
